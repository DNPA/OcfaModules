Mailwash uses a perlscript named 'dissectmail.pl' to do its job.
In order to make dissectmail.pl work, you'll have to
install:

MailTools
MIME-tools

These are found in the ./thirdparty directory. 
You can install from there or use the Mandrake CD's.

You should also make a symlink from /usr/bin/ to dissectmail.pl.
