This script creates two simple berkeley db binary tree files for quick lookups
by the digest modules. Currently two digest sources are parsed to create these files:

* kp1.hke   : 	The childpornography hashset of BDE Nijmegen. This is a file that
              	is basically in hashkeeper format, only the 'comment' field is
	      	filled with the SHA1 digest, as this is the prefered digest type
	      	for the OCFA.
* NSRLFile.txt:	This is the NIST hashset.

The script generates two lookup tables each in its own binary tree berkeleydb file.

* digestdb:	This lookup table maps from SHA1 (future extentions might include maps
		from MD5 sources also if there are source files parsed that only
		have MD5 digests available) to a string with the folowing format:

		<source>:<filename>

		The source is currently either "NIST" or "KPNIJMEGEN".

* adinfodb:	This lookup table extends the digest db with some sourcefile specific
		information. The key used here is : <source>:<digest> and every source
		can have a different string format for the aditional data mapper to.

NIST:	The nist source has the folowing sting in the values of the adinfodb map:

		<productcode>:<oscode>

		where productcode is an integer value that needs an other table to
		find the exact product involved, this table will need to be created
		for the digest module also as it will yield even more metadata that
		could be relevant for the digest module to add to the evidence meta xml.

KPNIJMEGEN: The BDE Nijmegen source has the 'directory' from the creation tree as value.
	    This directory structure yields information about what series the file
	    was part of and what type of immages it pertains.
